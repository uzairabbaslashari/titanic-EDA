# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed on the **Titanic dataset**.  
This project is completed as my **first task** during my **Data Science Internship at HexSoftwares**.

The analysis is carried out **using Python on Google Colab**, without relying on any external data sources.  
The main goal is to explore the dataset, clean the data, analyze relationships between variables, and extract meaningful insights related to passenger survival.
